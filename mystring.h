Write a string class. To avoid conflicts with other similarly named classes
MyString. This object is designed to make working with sequences of characters
a little more convenient and less error-prone than handling raw c-strings,
(although it will be implemented as a c-string behind the scenes). The MyString
class will handle constructing strings, reading/printing, and accessing characters.
In addition, the MyString object will have the ability to make a full deep-copy
of itself when copied. Makes the following refinements to the class in the last 
assignment. All the requirements from that class are still in force. For example,
all MyStrings must always be stored in a dynamic array that is exactly the correct
size to store the string. (score on this assignment will take into consideration
on both the previous assignment and this assignment.)

This MyString class must have only one data member, a c-string implemented as a
dynamic array. In particular, must not use a data member to keep track of the
size or length of the MyString. A full documentation is required for theis part.

In MyStrings class, Overload extraction Operator >> is implemented. Just like
the >> operator that reads C-strings, this >> operator will skip any leading
spaces and then read characters into the string up to the first whitespace character.
For convenience, impose a limit of 127 on the number of characters it can read. 
(Note that this does not mean that all MyStrings will always have a maximum of 127
characters. For example, you might get a MyString with more than 127 characters
by using the MyString constructor or by concatenating two MyStrings.)

This MyStrings class has a constant for the maximum input size and is declared
it in the public area of the class. It is static.

Read ability is also implemented, allows the client programmer to specify the
delimiting character (the character at which reading will stop). It works just
like the getline() function works for c-strings; that is, it places everything
up to but not including the delimiting character into the calling object, and it
also consumes (and discards) the delimiting character. It does not skip leading
spaces. The limit of 127 characters.

In MyStrings class, overload concatenation Operator + is implemented to do MyString
concatenation. The operator is able to handle either MyString objects or C-strings
on either side of the operator.  

In MyStrings class, the combined Concatenation/Assignment Operator is implemented.
Overload the shorthand += is to combine concatenation and assignment. Only MyStrings
can be on the left-hand side of a += operation, but either MyStrings or C-strings
may appear on the right side.  

In MyStrings class, a length member function that returns the number of characters
in the string is implemented.

In MyStrings class, construction of a MyString from a const c-string is implemented.
it deep copies the string data, not just store a pointer to an argument passed to
the constructor. 

In MyStrings class, default constructor is implemented, constructing a MyString
with no arguments creates an empty MyString object (i.e. ""). A MyString object
is implemented efficiently (space-wise), which does not have a fixed-size buffer
of chars, but instead allocate space for chars on an as-needed basis.
 
In MyStrings class, overload insertion operator << is implemented, which
printing a MyString to a stream. The overloaded << (insertion) operator, 
is simply print outits characters. 

In MyStrings class, MyString object can overload the square brackets [ ] operator
to allow direct access to the individual characters of the string. This operation
does range-check and assert if the index is out of bounds. two versions of the [ ]
operator are implemented. one is a const version that allows read access to the
chars, and another is a non-const version that returns the client a reference to
the char so they can change the value.

All six of the relational operators (<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=) are supported. They
are able to compare MyStrings to other MyStrings as well as MyStrings to c-string.
The ordering will be based on ASCII values. ASCII values are defined as uppercase
letters will always come before lowercase letters. Either MyStrings or c-string
can appear on either side of the binary comparison operator.
