# my_string_class
This object is designed to make working with sequences of characters a little more convenient and less error-prone than handling raw c-strings,(although it will be implemented as a c-string behind the scenes). The MyString class will handle constructing strings, reading/printing, and accessing characters. In addition, the MyString object will have
the ability to make a full deep-copy of itself when copied.
