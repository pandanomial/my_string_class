Write a string class. To avoid conflicts with other similarly named classes
MyString. This object is designed to make working with sequences of characters
a little more convenient and less error-prone than handling raw c-strings,
(although it will be implemented as a c-string behind the scenes). The MyString
class will handle constructing strings, reading/printing, and accessing characters.
In addition, the MyString object will have the ability to make a full deep-copy
of itself when copied. Use operator overload to print a MyString to a stream with
an overloaded insertion (<<) operator, this project implemented an overloaded
extraction (>>) operator and read() function. Also, Overload concatenation + 
operator and Combined Concatenation/Assignment Operator (+=), the shorthand +=, 
operator is implemented. All six of the relational operators (<,<=,>,>=,==,!=)
operators are required overload operators. Also, this class must have only one
data member, a c-string implemented as a dynamic array. In particular, must not
use a data member to keep track of the size or length of the MyString. A length
member function that returns the number of characters in the string is implemented.


Class Invariant: a MyString class must have only one data member, a c-string
				implemented as a dynamic array. In particular, must not use a
				data member to keep track of the size or length of the MyString.
